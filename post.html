        <h3>Private Cloud Server</h3>

        <p>This project was a part of my masters program in Software project management.
            <br> We worked in a Team of 3 but everybody tried to work differently so that everybody gets a hands on knowledgemodule.
            <!--exports = class { css() { return ( ) } install() { this.data = { } } })-->

            <br>
            <br> The private cloud was hosted on a powerful UNIX Engine called FreeBSD. It is also used by various cloud services, for eg. Netflix and iCloud.
            <br>
            <br> We used a open source API called Nextcloud, various prerequisites were needed before installation. Details on prerequisites can be found on Nextcloud Documentation.
            <br>
            <br> To access the webversion a DNS is needed. DynDNS provider DuckDNS was used to access the nextcloud via the internet. It can be setup using the home router.
            <br>
            <br> We worked on this project for 6 weeks.</p>

        <h3>Coherent heterodyne optical transmission system</h3>

        <p>In this project, coherent detection with heterodyne technique and few DSP techniques such as digital predistortion and carrier phase estimation for efficient transmissions of data is presented and characterized. In coherent detection, an optical
            receiver can monitor the phase of an optical transmitter to obtain any phase and frequency information carried by a transmitted signal. The thesis is also centered on developing Python script files for simulation of the optical communication
            system, where the development of drivers for test and measuring equipmentâ€™s for signal generation, acquisition, and transmission are conducted. The main objective of this thesis is to design, implement and test an optical coherent heterodyne
            transceiver. <br>In this project following goals are targeted to be accomplished:
            <ul>
                <br>
                <li>- Describe and study the fundamental principles of coherent communication.</li>
                <br>
                <li>- Review and design the optical coherent communication system and the architecture used to implement heterodyne detection technique.</li>
                <br>
                <li>- Design of an experimental set-up to incorporate an optical coherent communication system using commercially available devices.</li>
                <br>
                <li>- Design and performance analysis of the various compensation techniques required in a true, coherent optical receiver such as clock recovery, frequency offset estimation and phase estimation.</li>
                <br>
                <li>- Test and characterize the implemented communication system.</li>

        <h3>Signal processing techniques on Matlab</h3>

        <p>In this computational exercise, the fundamentals of a simple radio system are developed with diversity and space multiplex options using a numerical computer algebra system. For this purpose, the individual components of the system, the transmitter,
            a radio channel and a receiver, are simulated on the computer. As simulation environment MATLAB was be used. MATLAB offers a complete development environment (editor, command line, debugger,...).


            <br> The methods and techniques used adocument in a Git repository.



            <br> The methods and techniques used in this numerical are doucmented in a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nepsydude/Radio-fading-channel">Git repository</a>.
            <br>
            <br> The project was developed in a teamwork of maximum three, where we continiously and collaboratively searched and developed the algorithm to create signal processing algorithms.

        <h3>PCB Development with Proteus CAD</h3>
        <p>An electronic dice is to be developed for a new board game. The display is to be made with LEDs and be displayed exactly like a real dice. A 8-bit microcontroller from Microchip shall be used. The whole cube shall be realized in SMD construction.
            <br>The program was written in C language. For this we used the MPLABX development environment. After compiling the programmed source code a .hex file is automatically generated, which is then included in Proteus to test the to test the circuit
            with the program.The <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nepsydude/PCB-Design-LED-Cube">Git repository</a> has a copy of this code, if you like to try.

        <h3>Developing a biodegradable excrement packets</h3>
        <p> A bio-degradable packet idea was discussed in order to solve feces problem in base camp of Mt. Everest. Every year many climbers, explorers, including amateur tourists climb Mt.Everest. Through decades of use and exploration the area is extremely
            polluted by left excrements. To solve this problem we have designed a biodegradable pack(storage packet) where one can store their excrements and dump it in the recycling facility.
            <br>The details are in this <a target="_blank" href="debiopack.pdf">presentation</a>. We are still working to make this idea to come into life.
