        <h3>Private Cloud Server</h3>

        <p>This project was a part of my masters program in Software project management.
            <br> We worked in a Team of 3 but everybody tried to work differently so that everybody gets a hands on knowledgemodule.
            <!--exports = class { css() { return ( ) } install() { this.data = { } } })-->

            <br>
            <br> The private cloud was hosted on a powerful UNIX Engine called FreeBSD. It is also used by various cloud services, for eg. Netflix and iCloud.
            <br>
            <br> We used a open source API called Nextcloud, various prerequisites were needed before installation. Details on prerequisites can be found on Nextcloud Documentation.
            <br>
            <br> To access the webversion a DNS is needed. DynDNS provider DuckDNS was used to access the nextcloud via the internet. It can be setup using the home router.
            <br>
            <br> We worked on this project for 6 weeks.</p>
